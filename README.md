# AbstractSq

An NLP model utilizing vectorization and positional embeddings for abstract labeling.  

## Overview  
Abstract Sq is an innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) model designed to analyze and label abstracts effectively. By leveraging advanced techniques such as vectorization and positional embeddings, the model offers accurate classification and labeling of abstract content for various domains like academic research, technical reports, and more.  

## Features  
- **Vectorization**: Converts textual data into numerical vectors for semantic understanding.  
- **Positional Embeddings**: Captures the order and context of words to enhance labeling accuracy.  
- **Abstract Labeling**: Efficiently assigns labels based on semantic patterns and structural insights.  
- **Customizable**: Adaptable to multiple domains with minor fine-tuning.  

## Use Cases  
1. **Academic Research**: Labeling abstracts by topics such as AI, Physics, or Biology.  
2. **Technical Documentation**: Categorizing technical reports or summaries.  
3. **Content Classification**: Enhancing searchability and organization of content repositories.  

## Installation
